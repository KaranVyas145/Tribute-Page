                        Stan Lee was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Publications which would later become Marvel Comics' primary creative leader for two decades, leading its expansion
                        from a small division of a publishing house to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.

                <p id="content-extraordinary">
                    Stan Lee brought cartoon characters to life—in every sense of the word. What used to be “flawless” cartoon characters became regular human beings save their super powers in Stan’s own terms. He made them alive by giving them problems, insecurities, and
                    emotions. They no longer wear a mask and women started becoming part of the team and not just someone who needs saving. To put it simply, Stan turned the comics industry into a well-respected discipline.
